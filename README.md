# Uzo_scaffold
This is my first template

## What it does 
This project was to create a github scaffold with all the proper requirements 

### Important files include

1. Makefile

2. Dockerfile

3. A base set of libraries

If you look at main.py you will see a function defined for the subtraction of two objects. Test_main tests this function to be sure that it works.
